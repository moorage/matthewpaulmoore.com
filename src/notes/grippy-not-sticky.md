### 2026 Commentary

Cool things that this enables in robotics today that are hard even with machine vision + precision motion:

- Lift berries, grapes, tomatoes, peaches by contact + gentle wrap rather than squeezing.
- Pick up bread, tortillas, soft packaging.
- Remove eggs from cartons
- Handle wine glasses with thin stems
- Grip trash bags (film + show-through contents) without puncturing.
- Grab recycling bins, cardboard, odd plastic containers (textured/dirty).
- Lift takeout containers without collapsing them.
- Pick up a phone or remote lying flat without fingernail-like scooping.
- Lift envelopes, papers, mail without corner-peeling tricks.
- Grab textured produce (avocado skin), smooth plastics, paper cartons, foil wraps in a simpler planning model.
