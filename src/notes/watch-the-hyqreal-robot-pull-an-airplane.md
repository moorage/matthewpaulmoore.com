### 2026 Commentary:

Hydraulics might have fallen out of fashion for reasons like manufacturing simplicity, noise, lower maintenance, but this robot is a good reminder there are real-world jobs where we still need power density, shock tolerance, and sustained force in ugly environments. 

- Tasks like dragging, levering, bracing, towing, and stabilizing demand sustained high force more than top speed—and hydraulics still win on brute output per actuator volume/mass.
- Slips and impacts are hard on gears; hydraulic compliance and fluid power architectures can be more forgiving under abuse.
- Wet and dirty conditions are challenging for electric motors and gearboxes; hydraulics can be sealed and filtered more easily.
- For heavy manipulation, hydraulics can make the whole system less fragile when the mission is physical labor.

### Potential real-world use cases for a hydraulics-powered quadruped robot

- Moving heavy things that don’t roll
- Snow/ice property work
- Towing a small salt spreader, freeing stuck vehicles with a tow strap.
- Ranch / small-farm “muscle” tasks
- Pulling gates/sections into alignment, dragging feed bins, moving water tanks short distances, towing implements on uneven terrain.
- Dumpster/yard debris management
- Dragging things through mud
- Emergency utility access
- Forestry / landscaping support
- Stairs/threshold delivery assist (short-range)
