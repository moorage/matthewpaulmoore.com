Today I left a mug ring on a new notebook and decided to keep it. The circle is a witness: the page has already lived a little.[^ring]

<img class="ornament" src="{{ '/assets/ornaments/divider.svg' | url }}" alt="" aria-hidden="true" />

A quiet habit: at the end of the day, I list the three sentences that refused to leave me. Often they are not the ones I wrote.

[^ring]: The stain dries, the paper puckers, and the page becomes less precious, which is exactly when writing begins.
