It's official now (and public knowledge) - I am leaving [Google](http://www.google.com/intl/en/about.html) to work on a startup in Berkeley. I've learned a lot in my albeit short stint at Google. And I mean a lot. Most importantly, I feel honored to have been able to work with some of the smartest, most motivated people in the Silicon Valley - and maybe anywhere. I can only hope that our paths will cross later on. [Larry](http://www.google.com/corporate/execs.html#larry) , [Sergey](http://www.google.com/corporate/execs.html#sergey) , and [Eric](http://www.google.com/corporate/execs.html#eric) (and the rest of the executives) have built something truly unbelievable, and I can only hope to be a part of something that's half as successful. Google has changed the world with their products, and changed the way companies are run.\

I think what I'll miss most is actually the great hallway conversations. I don't know if there's any other place where you can walk around and literally see Nobel laureates, successful entrepreneurs, and the greatest hackers in the world, all in a single stroll. I have been humbled to be surrounded by so much greatness.\

And most of all, it was just plain fun, whether it was creating products used by millions, jumping in ball pits with friends and coworkers, shooting pool with family, or playing the wii (and so much more)! Thanks Google. There will always be a place in my heart for you!
