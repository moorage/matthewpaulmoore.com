In 2009, ThriveSmart took on a little charity called Citizen Effect as a client, building a fundraising platform for everyday people to be able to raise money for community-changing projects. It's some of our proudest work. In 2011, we turned the platform over to Citizen Effect to maintain on their own. And now, they're sharing the code with the world, open sourcing the *entire Ruby on Rails codebase*!

Though we only played a role in technology, we helped everyday people raise **$1 million from over 6,000 donors** in support of 75 amazing nonprofit partners. That effort improved the lives of 350,000 people around the world, having provided fresh water, solar powered lighting, and many more disruptive tools and infrastructure to those who needed it most.

We only hope that our future projects can help so many. Thank you, [Dan Morrison](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dan-morrison/0/42b/a16), for the privilege.
