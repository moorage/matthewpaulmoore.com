Some very smart/experienced entrepreneur mentors and investors of mine have been pushing me to *very succinctly* define what we want to be at CrowdMob when we grow up.  I realized they were in-fact just being nice, and what they were really asking for was a version of our business plan that **didn't** **suck**.

Together we came up with this madlib that all entrepreneurs should be able to fill-in to define their business plan:\
\

> At COMPANY-NAME, we are the #1 \_\_\_\_\_\_*[[product-category]]*\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in \_\_\_\_\_*[[broad-vertical]]*\_\_\_\_\_\_; and \_\_\_\_*[[product-category (again)]]*\_\_\_ is going to be the most important, fastest-growing niche because \_\_\_\_\_\_*[[reason]]*\_\_\_\_\_\_.

\
\

This sentence boils down to the heart of why the product you're making will matter financially.  The rest of the business plan / pitch is simply supporting evidence for this.   Take every other part of a typical pitch:

-   **Team skill set & background** - *Evidence that your team can make the #1 product?\
    \
    *
-   **Competitive landscape** - *Evidence that the broader vertical is important,  whether or not you can be #1, and how your niche is better.\
    \
    *
-   **Marketing plan** - *Evidence that you can be #1 in the minds of all your potential customers.\
    \
    *
-   **Pricing** - *Evidence that your niche is the most important.\
    \
    *
-   **Operational plan & Staffing needs** - *Evidence that you have a way to accomplish the vision.\
    \
    *
-   **Intellectual property plan** - *Evidence you can maintain the #1 spot.\
    \
    *
-   **Current financing & Funding plan** - *Evidence that you'll be around long enough and incentivized enough to accomplish the vision.*

Hopefully that's food for thought over the long holiday =)  Happy 4th, everyone!
