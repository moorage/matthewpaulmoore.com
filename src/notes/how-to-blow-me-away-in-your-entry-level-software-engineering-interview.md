It's never been a better time to be a software engineer in Silicon Valley.  If you're going out for your first "real world" software development job, here are the main things I hope you'll come in \*already\* having a decent handle on:

\- MVC ([Model--view--controller paradigm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller))\
- DOM Manipulation (Perhaps [with JQuery](https://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/))\
- How HTML Templating Frameworks operate (you could do worse than [using Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/))\
- Client-Side vs Server-Side frameworks (example: [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) with [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/))\
- RESTful Routing ([Rails has them built-in](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html))\
- How CSS Frameworks operate (e.g. [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/))\
- SQL Table & Index Design ([how would you optimize an SQL query](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_create_index.asp) to be faster?)\
- ORM ([Sequelize for NodeJS](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize) seems to be well-documented)\
- Page Caching & Partial Caching (Rails still has an [amazing caching layer](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#page-caching))\
- Git or Mercurial Source Code Management (just put your project on [GitHub](https://github.com/) already!)\
- TDD ([Test Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), and [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/) is pretty good)\
- Documentation formatting (like [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/)).\
- OAuth (implement signin with google, twitter, or facebook)

The best way to show me you have a decent handle on them, is to make an open source app that's available on GitHub and deployed on Heroku -- all for free!
