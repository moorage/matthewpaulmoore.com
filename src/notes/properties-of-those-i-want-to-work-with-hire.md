I've come to realize that I only really want to work with the following types of folks -- those who are:

\- Geniuses at their craft (or at least, significantly smarter than me at their craft)\
- Get Shit Done Attitude\
- Energy to deliver what they want to get done\
- Open, honest, and no-bullshit.

I'm sure there's more attributes I need to filter for, but based on my past experiences hiring, I want to at \*least\* optimize for those.
