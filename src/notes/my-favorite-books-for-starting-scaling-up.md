I’ve quite enjoyed going back over books I’ve read and recalling what I learned from all of them, from time to time. I figured it was time to post them somewhere in case it helps anyone else. I’ll continue to add new books to this list, and contribute additional notes as I review them–but here’s how I recall them at the moment which is in most cases, many years after reading them.

My thoughts of course, are just my humble opinion.

### My “Must-Reads” for Entrepreneurs of Any Stage

- [**The Lean Startup**: How Today’s Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898) by Eric Ries

- [**Principles**: Life and Work](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Life-Work-Ray-Dalio/dp/1501124021) by Ray Dalio
  *There are so many things I learned from Ray Dalio, it’s tough to sum up. Just read it!*
- [**A Curious Mind**: The Secret to a Bigger Life](https://www.amazon.com/Curious-Mind-Secret-Bigger-Life/dp/1476730776) by Brian Grazer and‎ Charles Fishman
  *Entrepreneurship is rooted in deep curiosity, and this is a fantastic book about just that topic.*

- [**The 21 Irrefutable Laws** of Leadership](https://www.amazon.com/21-Irrefutable-Laws-Leadership-Anniversary/dp/0785288376) by John C. Maxwell
  *Maybe it’s nostalgia, but these 21 ‘laws’ I learned 15 years ago still apply really well today.*
- [**Nonviolent Communication**: Create Your Life, Your Relationships, and Your World in Harmony with Your Values](https://www.amazon.com/Nonviolent-Communication-Relationships-NONVIOLENT-COMMUNICATION/dp/B001TKMKEO/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=) by Marshall Rosenberg
