I came across Dr. Deli Wang's UCSD research in Pulse magazine.  Very cool stuff.  Based on research published in: [Branched TiO2/Si nanostructures for enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211285512002248), they are able generate clean fuel.  Basically, photons bounce between nanowires, which absorb them with the water within.  This harvests the hydrogen gas, which can be used as fuel.

Can't wait to see this done at scale!
