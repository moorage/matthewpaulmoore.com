Never raised money before?  Here's the most basic (and important) thing investors want to know:

Given \$X in funding at this round, how much in \$Y revenue will that generate (or for consumer apps, how many Daily Active Users will \$X generate).

The other important thing to know is that most rounds of funding are supposed to last your company 18 months.

So if you're a first time entrepreneur, my question to you, is:

*(1) How much money do you have to raise so that you (and several friends) would work full time on your startup for 18 months?*

My follow up question would then be:

*(2) Above and beyond salaries, how much additional money do you need for 18 months of marketing + advertising, and what is your ROI on your advertising in the top 3 advertising channels?*

Knowing those answers ahead of time will save you a lot of wasted meetings with "potentially interested investors".
