My family is affected by autism, and we're of course not alone.  That's why I've been helping out some of my neighbors who are taking on a brilliant cause: seeking to place qualified people on the autism spectrum and other developmentally disabled individuals who are clients of the ARC of San Francisco into jobs.

These are individuals who are actually highly qualified and happy to do the jobs they are in, and government incentives are available for employers to hire them.
