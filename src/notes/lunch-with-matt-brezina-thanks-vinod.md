I had one of the most inspirational chats today that I've had in a long time. I met up with [Matt Brezina](http://www.facebook.com/people/Matt-Brezina/5723398) , a co-founder of Xobni. You might have heard of them, because [they just raised some pocket change from Kohsla Ventures](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=19&entry_id=14765) . Their sweet new office is near a [fantastic little deli](http://www.yelp.com/biz/xs50kbbXAR0uOcMsDWzp8w) .\

Hearing about Matt's adventures with his co-founder going through YCombinator, then going through the ropes raising money in Boston, and then actually landing funding in the Silicon Valley opened my eyes back up to the dream I've had since I was 13. It's so funny thinking back to freshman year of high school - instead of playing an afterschool sport, I was coding up a storm and meeting with "adults" about what it would take to start my own bubble business, "Surf Palo Alto (.com)" - hey it's still a good idea!! I wasn't too good at sports anyway.\
\
Well now Matt Brezina is getting to meet the who's who of Silicon Valley, both for work and for fun. I am truly, truly excited to be back in that environment. And hopefully, just hopefully I'll get invited to those exclusive parties he told me about! Oh, and I of course have to thank Vinod for covering lunch!
