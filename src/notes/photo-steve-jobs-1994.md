The only thing you really have in your life is time. And if you invest that time in yourself to have great experiences that are going to enrich you, then you can't possibly lose. So I always advise people: &ldquo;don't wait&rdquo;; do something when you're young, when you have nothing to lose. --- Steve Jobs, 1994
