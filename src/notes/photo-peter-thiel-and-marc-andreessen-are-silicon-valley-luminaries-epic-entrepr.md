title: "Photo: Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen are Silicon Valley luminaries, epic entrepreneurs and prominent financiers. Both have something to say about where high-tech is taking the world economy, and what is being left behind. Andreessen, co-developer of the first Web browser and now a top venture capitalist, expects software to automate and ultimately dominate most other industries. Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook, has written in depth about what he considers the stagnation of innovation in fields that others see as emblems of progress: energy, pharmaceuticals, space exploration, nanotech and much more. In fact, Thiel links the austerity gripping the Western world to productivity gains that never happened. Join these acute observers for a unique exchange on science, business and innovation, or the lack thereof."
