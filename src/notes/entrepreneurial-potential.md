As I get older, one of the things I've begun to think about is how to "pay it forward".  I also love mentoring others who share the passion for entrepreneurship but are simply earlier on in their journey.

\- Mental and emotional fortitude\
- Past "semi successes"\
- Correct analysis of current biggest bottleneck for the company and the next biggest bottleneck for the company\
- Are they honest, trustworthy, and able managers\
- Do they live and breathe "less is more"
