I have to hand it to them. When I first [joined Facebook (as a user)](http://www.facebook.com/people/Matthew-Moore/3300725) , I thought it was a great social network. But I never imagined anything close to [f8](http://developers.facebook.com/) at all. (the [best summary is at TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/24/facebook-launches-facebook-platform-they-are-the-anti-myspace/) ). They've really thought through the next big distribution model online for software applications. It's probably also going to revolutionize the way many goods ([virtual](http://www.vgsummit.com/) and not) are marketed online. This of course assumes that Facebook keeps doing well. But the better apps there are, it will make it so much harder for any of the userbase to leave. They're Microsoft 2.0 - the social software platform. And Facebook will be able to take a nice chunk of the revenue, since they have an ad on every single pageview of \*every app\* - not to mention they can do the payment processing. Imagine how MS would be doing if they have set this up for themselves way back when. Great job, Mark Zuckerberg and company. They really get social. And social is the future of the internet.\
\
As for [ThriveSmart](http://www.thrivesmart.com) , I think this means a lot. More than I can think of at this very instant. I know that people's lives are increasingly online, and that if you book an appointment somewhere, you might very well be proud to show that off in your Facebook profile. And you probably want to know what Dentist your friends use if they are really happy with the dentist and you're not so happy with yours.\
\
Not to mention the fact that this just shows the importance of creating platforms, and eco-systems. If you help others make a ton of money, you'll be sure to make a ton yourself. I have some pretty good ideas one what we can do in that arena, but I definitely want to flesh it out before I post anything embarrassing  . Thankfully, other businesses not in the web 2.0 space will take a little while to migrate, so we at least have a few months!
