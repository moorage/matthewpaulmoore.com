This project is an experiment in continuity: can a set of tools help a writer return to an idea rather than abandon it? The tools are simple: templates, tags, and a rhythm of review.

> The tools are not the garden. They are the watering can.

The first tool is a daily index.

1. Recopy a sentence.
2. Name one unresolved question.
3. Leave a trail of links.

The second is a small ritual: each week, prune the list and add a note to the plot that has gone quiet.[^tools]

```
# example daily script
journal open --today
journal note "question: what does this idea want?"
```

[^tools]: These tools are the opposite of a system. They are just enough structure to make returning easy.
