I was raised in Palo Alto and Berkeley during the 1980s and 1990s, surrounded early by the raw materials of Silicon Valley and the sense that the world was changeable. That pushed me into starting a company in high school, an entrepreneurship org. at UCSD, and joining Google upon graduation.

After leaving Google, I chased the startup dream several times and have my share of wins as well as battle scars to show for it.  I've had Bill Campbell tell me he wished I hadn't asked him that question (it was a hard one), and had Marc Andreessen tell me I better win (ok, with a smile).  I've raised millions of dollars from top-tier VCs and angels, and also had to tell employees and investors that we were out of money and had to shut down. I've built products used by millions of people, and I've also built products I couldn't sell to my mom.  It's been a wild ride so far.

I love playing at intersection of product, engineering, and marketing in bleeding edge software & robotics.
