# Style Checklist

- Single-column layout with 62–72ch measure and generous margins.
- Paper background, near-black text, muted accent; visited links distinct.
- EB Garamond body, Source Sans 3 for small UI/meta only.
- Line height 1.6–1.75; paragraph first-line indent except after headings/lists/lede.
- Section labels in small caps; oldstyle figures and ligatures enabled.
- Ornaments used sparingly between sections and around footnotes/endnotes.
- Links understated underline with offset; hover increases thickness.
- No cards, gradients, or heavy UI; typography carries hierarchy.
- Strong focus states, semantic HTML, skip link.
- Print styles hide navigation and keep black text on white.
